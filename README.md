Legacy Windows Forms DataGrid for .Net Core

It's never a good idea to invest on a legacy deprecated control, but if you're still stuck on that for a particolar project ...
here you'll find something that let you move forward.

This Solution is based on .Net Framework (4.8.1) sources migrated to .Net Core 8 (targets: <TargetFrameworks>net481;net8.0-windows</TargetFrameworks>), and a sample demo project where you'll find how use it.
